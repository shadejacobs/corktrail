Sample Project Outline: Corktrail
I. Introduction
Objective:
Design and develop a responsive web application that showcases vineyards from around the
world, featuring random vineyard selections, visual data displays, and user interactivity. Also,
allow customers to see the current wine selection at each establishment.
Tools and Technologies:
HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries), JavaScript, Chart.js, Fetch API, and Express.js.
Goals:
● Build a mobile-responsive layout for smooth usability across devices.
● Fetch and present dynamic vineyard-related data using APIs or JSON datasets.
● Integrate interactive visualizations, such as charts showing vineyard locations, wine
types, or production stats.
● Utilize third-party APIs for data retrieval.
● API retrieval from Instagram to grab keywords to be able to alert a vineyard to confirm
their newly released wine.
II. Responsive Design
1. Implementation
● Media Queries: Implement media queries to adapt the layout for mobile and
desktop screen sizes.
● CSS Grid and Flexbox: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create flexible and responsive
layouts.
● Responsive Components: Ensure all components (graphs, forms, tables) adjust
appropriately across different devices.
III. Feature Implementation
1. Selected Features
● Feature 1: Use arrays, objects, sets, or maps to store and retrieve information
displayed in the app.
● Feature 2: Visualize data in a user-friendly way (e.g., graphs, charts).
● Feature 3: Retrieve data from a third-party API and display it within the app.
● Backup Feature: Analyze text and display useful information (e.g., word/character
count).
2. Integration of Third-Party API
● Google Map API - to help find vineyards
● OpenFoodFacts API – Includes wine data, not vineyard-specific
● Custom JSON - custom to vineyard, specific to be able to display what is on tap.
● Instagram api
IV. Data Handling and Analysis
1. Data Storage and Retrieval
● Store reviews of vineyards and wine in the database.
● Implement functionality to update and retrieve this data as needed.
2. Data Visualization
● Use the google api to search radius of vineyards to be able to plan your day.
● Implement additional visualizations to compare customer and vineyard reviews
per bottle, per year, and per category of wine.
● V. Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Form and Data Storage
● Create a form to allow users to input data (e.g., location, date range) and retrieve
relevant weather.
● Store submitted values using an external API (e.g., JSONBin.io).
2. Data Persistence
● Persist data to an external API and make it accessible within the app, even after a
reload/refresh.
3. Interactive UI Features
● Implement features like data sorting, autocomplete for location input, and
interactive date-picker for date selection.
VI. Project Development
1. Node.js Web Server
2. Database Interaction
● (Optional) Use MongoDB to store and retrieve weather and CO2 emissions data.
3. JavaScript Framework
● (Optional) Develop the project using React for enhanced interactivity and state
management.
VII. Review Process
1. Internal Review
● Perform thorough testing to ensure the application meets all specified
requirements.
● Validate the responsiveness and functionality of all components.
2. External Feedback
● Present the project to peers or mentors for feedback.
● Incorporate feedback to refine and polish the application.
VIII. Documentation and Final Submission
1. Code Annotation and Documentation
● Annotate code with clear comments and explanations.
● Write a comprehensive README.md file covering:
● Project overview and objectives.
● Setup and installation instructions.
● Usage guidelines and feature descriptions.
● Data sources and API integration details.
2. Final Submission
● Ensure the project is fully functional and well-documented.
● Prepare the project for final presentation or submission to evaluators.
